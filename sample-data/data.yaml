    description: >
      Geographic Identifier - fully concatenated geographic code (State FIPS and
      County FIPS). The Census Bureau and other state and federal agencies are
      responsible for assigning geographic identifiers, or GEOIDs, to geographic
      entities to facilitate the organization, presentation, and
      exchange of geographic and statistical data. GEOIDs are numeric codes that
      uniquely identify all administrative/legal and statistical geographic areas for
      which the Census Bureau tabulates data. From Alaska, the largest state,
      to the smallest census block in New York City, every geographic area
      has a unique GEOID. Data users rely on GEOIDs to join the appropriate
      demographic data from censuses and surveys, such as the
      American Community Survey (ACS), to various levels of geography for data
      analysis, interpretation and mapping.
